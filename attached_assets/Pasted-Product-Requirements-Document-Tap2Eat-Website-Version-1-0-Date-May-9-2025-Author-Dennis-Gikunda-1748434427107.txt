7. Non-Functional Requirements
7.1 Performance:
Fast page load times (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5 seconds).
Optimized images and assets.
7.2 Security (OWASP Top 10 - 2021):
The website must be developed with mitigations for the OWASP Top 10 2021 vulnerabilities:
A01:2021 – Broken Access Control: Ensure proper authorization checks for any restricted areas or future authenticated sections.
A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures: Use HTTPS exclusively. If any sensitive data is handled (e.g., contact forms), ensure secure transmission. Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily.
A03:2021 – Injection: Sanitize all inputs (e.g., search queries, contact form fields if implemented). Use parameterized queries if database interactions occur.
A04:2021 – Insecure Design: Adhere to secure design principles throughout development. The current scope is largely informational, but this is critical for any future expansions involving user data.
A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration: Harden server configurations, remove default credentials, ensure only necessary services are exposed. Keep all software and frameworks up to date.
A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Use up-to-date libraries and frameworks for development. Regularly scan for and patch vulnerabilities in third-party components.
A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures: If account management portal becomes a feature, implement strong authentication (MFA if possible), secure password policies, and robust session management. For now, guidance to USSD is primary.
A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures: Ensure that any software updates or content changes are from trusted sources and verified. Use SRI for external resources if applicable.
A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Implement basic logging for server errors and unusual activity. For an informational site, extensive logging might be overkill but have basic audit trails.
A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): If the server makes requests to other URLs based on user input (unlikely for current scope but good practice), validate and sanitize these URLs.
7.3 Responsiveness: Fully functional and visually appealing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
7.4 Usability: Highly intuitive, easy to navigate, and user-friendly as per the primary project goal.
7.5 Scalability: Built with consideration for future growth in content and potentially features (e.g., more detailed account portal, blog/news section).
7.6 Maintainability: Code should be well-structured, commented, and easy for future developers (or AI iterations) to update.
8. Success Metrics
Engagement:
Page views per section (Parent vs. Admin).
Time spent on page (especially for guides and FAQs).
Bounce rate.
Effectiveness:
Number of downloads from the Resource Library.
Reduction in common queries to the support phone line (tracked manually).
User feedback collected via surveys or a simple feedback mechanism (if implemented).
Usability:
Completion rates for key tasks (e.g., finding FAQ, navigating to enrollment info). (Could be assessed via usability testing).
Accessibility:
Compliance with WCAG guidelines (checked via automated tools and manual review).
9. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements
Full-fledged online parent account management portal (beyond USSD guidance).
School administrator login for direct communication or advanced reporting.
Blog/News section for program updates.
Multilingual support.
Interactive tools or calculators (e.g., meal cost estimator).
Integration with a CRM for contact form submissions.
This PRD provides a comprehensive guide for an AI coding tool to create the Tap2Eat website. It balances detailed specifications with the understanding that an AI will perform the generation, focusing on clear, actionable requirements.
